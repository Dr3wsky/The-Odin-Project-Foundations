This repository is to track work and publish results from The Odin Project (TOP) Foundations course.

TOP is an open-source curriculum maintained by course alumni who used the resources to self-teach themselves wev devellopment and transition into SE roles. 

I am using TOP to gain the fundamentals of web and web app devellopment with popular web frameworks to supplement my Python learnings through gradschool. With the ultimate goal of doing more Data Science and back-end type of roles, TOP will provide a good foundation and basic portfolio for front-end languages and interfacing. 

The Foundations course covers the basics of:
- Command-line and git basics
- Setting up a devellopment environment
- HTML & CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript basics
- Back-end and frameworks
