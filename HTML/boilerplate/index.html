        <h1>Welcome to The Odin Project Foundations</h1>
        <h2>The following is an HTML boilerplate</h2>
        <h3>Paragraphs and Body:</h3>
        <p>This HTM boilerplate is good practice for both making wabpage templates and practicing with HTML.</p>
        <p>And now I am making a new paragraph to differentiate between paragraph and headertags with 
            <strong>bolded text</strong> and also 
            <em>emphasized</em> text. </p>
        <p>I can also do both by introducing myself - My name is <em><strong>Andrew McFadden </strong></em></p>

    <!-- Just like with any other code we can write comments in HTML too-->
    <!-- Now we are going to look at the formatting options with lists -->
    
    <h3>Lists:</h3>
        <p>Lists are generated based on the requirement of ordering. If I want to rank my favourite movies of all time then I need an ordered list.<br>
        <strong>Andrew's top three movies of all time:</strong> 
        <ol>
            <li>The Italian Job</li>
            <li>Interstellar</li>
            <li>That Awkward Moment</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Whereas if I want an unordered list, it uses bullet points. For example, a shopping list:
            <ol>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
                <li>Caesar Dressing</li>
                <li>Chicen Breast</li>
                <li>Dried Cranberries</li>
                <li>Sunflower Seeds</li>
                <li>Parmasan Cheese</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
