        <h1>Welcome to The Odin Project Foundations</h1>
        <h2>The following is an HTML boilerplate</h2>
        <p>This HTM boilerplate is good practice for both making wabpage templates and 
            practicing with HTML.</p>
        <p>And now I am making a new paragraph to differentiate between paragraph and header
            tags with 
            <strong>bolded text</strong> and also 
            <em>emphasized</em> text. </p>
        <p>I can also do both by introducing myself -   
            My name is <em><strong>Andrew McFadden </strong></em> </p>
